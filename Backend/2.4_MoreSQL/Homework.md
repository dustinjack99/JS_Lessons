We've done it! Now we're consuming data from a live database and displaying it in our JS! Believe it or not, you are now FULL STACK DEVELOPERS!!

For your homework, I want you to use the inquirer.js package to create another command-line app. (I said I didn't want to make you do a lot of these, I'm hoping this is the last one.) This app will query the top5000 database we created in class.

Accomplish these tasks in your homework:

1. Referencing (not copying) the lesson file I've created, finish the skeleton command-line app I've made in your homework folders.

   - This is all contained within your `server.js` file.

2. Create three more options that a user can select from, all logging different kinds of data to the console.

- BONUS: Make use of 'JOINS' in these three extra choices.

TIPS: Google is your friend. This homework does not give you a lot of answers, and it's up to you to find them. Documentation for these libraries is your friends. Remember - the way you're using SQL in Node is a library itself. Look for the documentation there if you get lost. Also take the time to use the links below if you want to deepen your learning on any subject we cover.
