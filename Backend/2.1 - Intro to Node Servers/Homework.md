Holy cow, we've written our own servers!!

Like last week, this homework will probably seem fairly quick to accomplish, but practicing the tasks are important.

This week you must:

1. Make your very own 3-page HTML website. Unlike your other projects in the past, you must serve these through your server.

2. You must use routes, along with the node http and fs libraries.

3. The website itself must be HTML files... FROM YOUR PREVIOUS PROJECTS. DUN DUN DUUUN. You are not allowed to write any html on your own.

Insight:
Unlike looking at your projects in the past, being able to use servers to send your HTML is how your websites will operate in the wild.

This is also the bridge that will help connect us to the world of databases, so get pumped for data!
