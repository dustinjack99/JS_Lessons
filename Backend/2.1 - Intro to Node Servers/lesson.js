//Client / Server model REMINDER!
// Client's send a request from the front end.
// Server sends a response from the back end.
// Those response objects you've been working with has been from servers.

// Servers and Routing are two of the
// MOST IMPORTANT CONCEPTS

// Forewarning, this is challenging stuff
// Once we have servers, routing, and databases,
// you can do ANYTHING.

// Q: What is a server?
// req / res

// Ex: server-side verbs / functions
// visiting URL and getting HTML
// hitting an API endpoint and getting JSON

// Q: What is a client?

// How do servers / clients communicate?
// HTTP! HyperText Transfer Protocol
// two-way handshake of req / res

// During development, our PC's can be both client AND server!

//MVC
// Model / View / Controller
// Model - Handles business logic
// View - Thing the user sees, what the server sends back
// Controller - Orchestrates what happens, handles routes
