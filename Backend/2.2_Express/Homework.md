Express! The best way to handle API routing, and to get your backend server up and running in no time!

Express is a fantastic way to write dynamic rules to your APIs, and scale them up dramatically. 

We've also written a basic app that GETs and POSTs data to your API! Your homework is to do the same!

I want you to write an app with it's own backend API with Express. 

1. You must GET / POST data from the dummy database.json file provided.

2. Your app must be able to GET information based on dynamic /api/ routes. 
    - Example: If I navigate to /api/characters/baby-yoda, I want to see the info for /baby-yoda. 
    - Extra credit: We've seen the routes serve up JSON data - now turn that into an HTML webpage. 

3. The website must be fully styled, make it look pretty.

4. The site only needs to be one HTML page - all it needs it to POST data to your API.

5. Above all else, DO NOT COPY / PASTE from lesson.js, it is ordered in a way that will fail. This is to encourage you to look up the documentation and problem-solve yourselves ;)
