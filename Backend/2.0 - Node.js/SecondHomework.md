We've taken our first steps into Node, which will be our bridge across the frontend to the backend!

You learned how to use Node, NPM, and JavaScript outside of the browser.

Armed with your new found knowledge of Node, write me a command-line app that does the following:

1. You should be able to run the app with 'node <filename>'.

2. Your app should be a quiz game! Using Inquirer.js, I want users to be able to answer your app's questions.

3. Use the value of these answers to check and see what the user's score is, then print their score once the game is over.

Tips:
This is your first foray into downloading and using someone else's code to accomplish your task. You will need to refer to the inquirer docs to finish this homework, which is INVALUABLE when coding. I won't give you a link to their docs, but some googling with the word 'npm' will probably get you there ;)
