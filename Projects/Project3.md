**_ PROJECT 3 _**

Project 3 is here! The requirements are a lot of the same for Project 2, but a slight bit more freedom, and using React. You must build:

- A fully-styled, responsive user interface, built with React.

- Backend routing using Express.

- All four CRUD operations using a PostgreSQL database (who remembers what these are?)

- Like last project, you are more than welcome to have more than four operations. Remember that relating data (JOINS) is what SQL was built for. It's a powerful thing to have on your resume.

- Three third-party NPM libraries we haven't used or covered.

  - These libraries can be used for anything - for making your CSS better, animations, adding types to your JS code, other database libraries aside from Sequelize, etc... (these are all good hints, but by all means shop around when discussing).

- Your app must be hosted, deployed, and running on Heroku.com.

- The GitHub repository must belong to someone on the team who didn't host your first OR second project.

- Demo Day Presentation:
  - Make a 10 minute presentation showcasing your app. I want the presentation to cover:
  - A User Story: Why users need your app, and what it solves for them.
  - Division of Labor: Who worked on what parts of the project.
  - Tech Stack: The technologies you've used to build the app.
  - A live demo of the app running.
  - There will be a Q&A section after your 10 minute presentation.

The sky is the limit! Really take time during catch-up week to discuss what kind of app you want to build, and what libraries you could use to accomplish your needs / goals.

**_ TIPS _**

- Avoid being the 'lead', even the person hosting the repository on GitHub. You're all equals, and you all can self-motivate and accomplish the tasks you need to get done.

- Communicate and touch your codebase as often as possible.

- I'd recommend brainstorming the app first, THEN hunt down libraries. However - if you find a library / API that you want to make the focus of the project, that could work.

- For project ideas, youtube has a lot of great content creators that have built amazing things with Node, JS, and other NPM libraries. I also can't recommend enough some of the random Frontend Masters projects, they've built some really cool stuff.

- Oh, and COMMUNICATE AND TOUCH YOUR CODE AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLE.
  - Something that has made me very proud of you all is that after Project 2, you all started asking for more help, putting more effort into your homework, and COLLABORATING! Keep this UP! :) :) :)
