We've taken our first steps into Node, which will be our bridge across the frontend to the backend!

You learned how to use Node, and using JavaScript outside of the browser.

Using your newfound knowledge of Node, write me a command-line app that does the following:

1. You should be able to run the app with 'node <filename>'.

2. Your app should be able to append HTML to one of your previous homework HTML files, using only files in your homework folders. 

3. Dealer's choice - you can write a new HTML file or use a currently existing one!

Tips: Remember you must be in your correct file directory. The commands to get there is 'cd' and to list the directories is 'ls', and to bash outside of a directory, use 'cd ..'.

Also: Don't be a dick and overwrite other peoples files.
