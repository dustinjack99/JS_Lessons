Now we're cooking! We've touched on how React can handle routing, passing data to child components with 'props', state management using forms, and even fetching asynchronous data with axios!

For your next assignment, follow this criteria:

1. Make your own create-react-app inside this folder (which you've done already if you've been coding along).

2. Install axios - run `npm i axios`, then make yourself a React component that calls and uses axios.

3. In this React component, I want you to call a third-party API of your choice. This can be an API you've worked with in the past.

- This API must return NESTED data.

4. Using this JSON data, it is your job to write several components that can consume and render it.

- A good rule of thumb for this lesson: if you run into nested data, that 'deeper' nested data can be another component.

5. As always... STYLING! DAZZLE ME WITH YOUR CSS!

**_HINTS_**
Remember that your components can consume data, called 'props'. This is how you'll be able to pass down data from parents components to their children.

This is going to be valuable practice for getting async data to work with your React components - this will be put into practice with a live Postgres database come Project 3... which is only 2 weeks away! Golly!
