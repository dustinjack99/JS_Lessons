      <p>
        My name is Neal Fisher - I was born and raised in the Midwest, currently
        based in Memphis, TN. I can only describe myself as an artist. It's hard
        to think of myself any other way.
        <br />
        <br />
        My interests are mainly artistic and entertainment centered, but I just
        like learning new things in general, whether or not they're obviously
        connected to art.
