This week's homework is easy, but MANDATORY, in ALL CAPS.

Watch the Frontend Masters course on git:
https://frontendmasters.com/courses/git-in-depth/

This is a three hour course, and it may seem dry, but this lesson and the video lecture will pay off tremendously when you start collaborating on your first project.

It's important to have an understanding of version control and all the tools it gives us. The basics will be re-taught in the video, as well as introduce you to some more advanced things.

Going forward, the most we'll do is pull code from the repo we've been working with.

However, once we start collaborating, you'll be VERY THANKFUL once we know git. It will prevent us from constantly overwriting each other's code. It also has to power for us to roll back to a previous commit if we mess up our code beyond the point of saving it.

GIT. IS. A. LIFESAVER.

Cheers, and have fun watching the video. :)
