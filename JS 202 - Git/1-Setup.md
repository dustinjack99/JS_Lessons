Hello, coders!

Today we're setting up your GitHub accounts and installing 'git', allowing you to collaborate with each other (and more easily grab code from our lessons). Let's talk about what git and GitHub are!

GitHub is the place where lots of individual coders and companies host their code. This is the place where we'll have our collaborative projects and where you can host your portfolios.

Git, on the other hand, is the tool we'll use to interact and collaborate with each other. It's a tool called 'version control', and serves as a way for people to work on a single codebase without conflicting with each other.

Before we get into the lesson, let's get the setup done.

1. Create a GitHub profile: https://github.com/

2. Install git: https://git-scm.com/downloads

3. After you install git, open VS Code and press CTRL + ~ to open your terminal. Then type this to see if you installed correctly: `git --version`

4. Tie your github accounts to your git installations with these commands:

`$ git config --global user.name "GitHub username here"`
`$ git config --global user.email "githubEmail@example.com"`

Once all of our git installations are up and running, let's talk about the theory of what we're about to use. Move over to 2-Lesson.md, and sit back while I vomit words at you.
