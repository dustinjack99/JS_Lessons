This week, you'll be building your own weather app! (HOWEVER! If you found an API you MUST work with, go for it!)

Users should be able to search the name of a city, and have the weather info for the city display on the site. (If you're using a different API, wow us with functionality!)

Using the fetch() method, call the 5 day, 3 hour forecast from OpenWeatherMap. You will use the response to template out and display the weather data you get back. Here's the address you'll call the fetch() with:

`http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?q={city name}&appid={API key}`

Take the steps to make your own html, css, and js files. Here is your own API keys to get info from Open Weather's API

If you're a boss using your own API, you'll need to look up the steps on how to access it.
