Hooray! You've learned about Arrays, Loops, and If / Else Blocks!

Your homework is to make a Password Generator website! Users should be able to use your website for making their own passwords. Here's the criteria:

1. Users should be able to choose between and generate passwords with:
   Uppercase letters: "ABC"
   Lowercase letters: "abc"
   Symbols: "!@#"
   Numbers: "123"

2. Users should be able to select the length of their passwords (up to 20 characters).

3. This only needs to be a single HTML webpage, with very minimal styling (but feel free to style it up for extra credit).

Helpful hints:

Checkboxes are a great (boolean) way to toggle what a user wants.

Math.floor(Math.random()) is the best way for getting a random value (like a character for a password).

- This homework is HARD! I'm here to help, but I'm going to try being somewhat hands-off. This is to let you experiment and deduce solutions. Approach this problem in small bits - this is homework you will crash and burn on if you try it all at once.

- Most importantly: THERE IS NO ONE WAY TO SOLVE THIS! There is literally hundreds of solutions for this problem. Whatever way you initally try solving this, GO FOR IT! :)
