Good news! Your homework this week is polishing / catching up on homework that was previously unfinished, or homework you weren't satisfied with.

On top of that, it's time to start thinking about what you want to do for your first project. Look at Project-1.md for the guidelines of what will be in your first project.

Start brainstorming, and feel free to message each other about what you all want the first project to look like.
