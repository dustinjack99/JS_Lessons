// This week is a buffer week!

// No matter what the level you're at, now is the time to request
// that I go over topics we've already covered.

// Topics:
// 1. Variables, Data Types, Functions
// 2. Conditional Logic, Arrays, Loops
// 3. Git!
// 4. DOM Manipulation / the DOM itself
// 5. Fetch and Async JS
// 6. More about APIs

// This week is going to be a cushion before we leap into...
// Project #1!!!
