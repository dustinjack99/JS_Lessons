Project #1:

You will have two whole weeks to plan, build, and deploy your first project together. The guidelines are:

1. You must use two third-party APIs to build out the functionality of your app.

2. The app must be interactible - it can be something useful, informative, or make a game out of it!

3. There must be 3 seperate web pages a user can navigate to.

4. This app must be fully styled with CSS. Make it sparkle!

5. The functionality must only use vanilla JS (this is a guideline for Ben).

6. On the GitHub repo, you must make a Readme.md file that describes the purpose of your app and how to use it.

Finally, because I'm nice, here's a working example of my first project, a speed-spelling game called Scrabble Dabble:

Hints: If you want to peek at the JavaScript we used, go into src/script.ts

Final Considerations:
This project is a collaboration between all three of you. Respect each other's time and effort, always communicate. Set aside a few times each week where you can all get together and hammer out some of the project.

Commit your changes early, and often. Talk with your teammates whenever a git conflict happens.

// TEACHER NOTE: //
Pitch the idea of tailoring each project for someone's portfolio.
