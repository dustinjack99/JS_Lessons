Project #1:

You will have two whole weeks to plan, build, and deploy your first project together. The guidelines are:

1. You must use two third-party APIs to build out the functionality of your app.

2. The app must be interactible - it can be something useful, informative, or make a game out of it!

3. There must be 3 seperate web pages a user can navigate to.

4. This app must be fully styled with CSS. Make it sparkle!

5. On the GitHub repo, you must make a Readme.md file that describes the purpose of your app and how to use it.
