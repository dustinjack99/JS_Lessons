// Woo! Look at our running React App!
// Now delete everything but index.html in /public, then delete bloat in index.html.
// Delete everything in but App.js and index.js in /src, delete the bloat in both files.

// Point out public/index.html root div
// - All our JS is being imported and stuffed into the root div
// - Unlike Angular JS, we only import App.js and have no need to import
// ever single controller, factory, library and bloat our single html file.

// Our First Component
// We write React with a special language called JSX. It stands for JavaScript XML,
// but it's basically a way to write HTML in your React components.

// The Catch!
// This is not actually HTML. It looks like it, but this is still JavaScript under the
// hood. And we need tools like babel and webpack to turn JSX into browser-readable JavaScript.

// MAKE FIRST REUSEABLE COMPONENT
// Simple Div that says First Component

// PROPS
// Well what if we need to make this information dynamic. This clearly isn't a very
// functional or useful component.

// This is where Props come in. Props, short for properties, are what you can pass
// to these components to have them display the sweet, sweet dynamic data that we
// get paid so well to wrestle with.

// show off .map w/ food and hobby object.

// STATE
// Let's start using some state hooks. React's way of keeping track of data that
// changes throughout using your components.
// (Use a Counter Component)

// NESTING COMPONENTS
// Make List and ListItem components

// FUN JS STUFF
// conditional rendering w/ ternary operators
