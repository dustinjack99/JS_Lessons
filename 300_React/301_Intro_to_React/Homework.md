We have dipped our toes in React, and just to summarize what we covered today:

**_React Is..._**

- A view engine, and one of the most in demand front end libraries on the market.
- A library that combines HTML and JS into reusable JSX components.
- These components can consume data, and render this data into your UI with HTML syntax.
- Can be worked with just like vanilla JS, which means you have all the functionality of conditional logic, loops, functions, etc available for you to use.
- React is much, MUCH more, but we will cover all of this in later lessons. We've only scratched the surface...

For your homework, I want you to:

1. Make a rock, paper, scissors app using React!

- By all means, use create-react-app to get yourself up and running.

2. I want a reusable React component that renders a Scissors button, Paper button, and Rock button.

- Use 'props', the last thing we covered in today's lesson, to accomplish this.

3. I want you to be playing against an AI that randomly chooses 'rock', 'paper' or 'scissors', which is checked against what a user clicks as their 'throw'.

4. I want styling! I haven't made this a requirement for some time, but I want to see some CSS chops. Feel free to shop around and use external libraries.

**_ Extra Credit _**
If you get this far in a short amount of time, I want you to track the user's score and CPU's score using the useState() hook, which you can google and read about in the React docs. The secondary resource will also cover this functionality in much greater depth.

We will be going over using 'state' in the next lesson, but this is a great way to get a head start.
