Now we know what the DOM is, and how to work with it!

With this knowledge, I want you to make a single-paged HTML website, with one very important detail:

You are not allowed to write any HTML tags inside your HTML file, aside from the boilerplate HTML (such as the body tag). All of your HTML nodes and CSS must be created from, and worked on, in JavaScript.

You must create a quiz website, where your users answer a quiz you've written on any subject of your choosing. The quiz must behave like this:

1. Your quiz must be on a timer.
2. There must be at least 10 questions.
3. Each question the user answers must advance them to another question.
4. You must keep score for the user, and display it for them once the quiz is over.

Again, this must all happen in your JavaScript file. No HTML or CSS!

Hints:
I would recommend storing your questions and answers in their own arrays. That's all the hint you get!

Also, here's a working example, brought to you by our good friend, Ben!
