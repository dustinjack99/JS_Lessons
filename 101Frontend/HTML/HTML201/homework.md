You've taken your first steps into WebDev! Hooray!

To recap your learning of HTML, here's some exercises that you can do:

1. Create a three-page website that uses these HTML tags to structure your webpage. Your webpage should have three pages:
    - An About Me Page
    - A Home Page
    - A Hobbies Page

2. Use these tags that we covered somewhere on your three pages:
    - `<a>` tags to navigate between your web pages. Along with linking to another website entirely.
    - `<h1>` tags to lay our important headers.
    - `<p>` tags to display text information.
    - `<img>` tags to find images around the internet.
    - `<ol> / <li>` tags to make a list of data.
