JavaScript 101:
You’ve taken your first steps into writing JavaScript! Woo!

My best advice is to be patient. Writing in your first coding language is a lot to take in. Your brain has never thought this way, and digesting the words on the screen takes time.

That being said! Here’s your homework:

We’ve worked with declaring variables, learning data types, and writing functions.

In your three-page website, I want you to add a JavaScript file for each page.
In one of your pages, I want a button that fires a function that works with numbers. This can be either displayed on the page itself or in an alert() function.

In another page, I want a button that figures a function that works with strings. This can be either displayed on the page itself or in an alert() function.

In your last page, I want a button that fires a function that works with numbers AND strings. This can be either displayed on the page itself or in an alert() function.

After your website is injected with hot, sexy JS goodness, continue watching Intro to Web Development on Front End Masters. Start at Programming Fundamentals, and watch through Scope Solution: https://frontendmasters.com/courses/web-development-v2/
