This week, you'll be building your own weather app!

Users should be able to search the name of a city, and have the weather info for the city display on the site.

Using the fetch() method, call the 5 day, 3 hour forecast from OpenWeatherMap. You will use the response to template out and display the weather data you get back. Here's the address you'll call the fetch() with:

`api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?q={city name}&appid={API key}`

Take the steps to make your own html, css, and js files. Here is your own API keys to get info from Open Weather's API
