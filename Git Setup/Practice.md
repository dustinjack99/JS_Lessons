`Teacher: add everyone as collaborators to the Repo.`

Let's start out by pulling down the code of the lessons. This is how you'll be getting the code from our lessons from here on out - and it's a hell of a lot easier than constantly downloading from something like Google Drive.

Here's the steps to start us off, which will grab the project Repo:
**Repo is short for 'repository', which is the place where our codebase lives.**

1. Go to the GitHub Repo: https://github.com/dustinjack99/JS_Lessons

2. Open your Desktop in the code editor. Then open your VS Code terminal again (CTRL + `).

3. Copy the "git clone" address from the repo. Put it in your terminal, and hit 'Enter'.

This will clone a version of the Repo onto your system. From here, you'll be able to pull down changes and updates I make to the 'Master Branch' of these coding lessons.

THAT'S NOT ALL! You, yourselves, will be able to make changes and push them to the repo. Let's test this out! Our first step is making different 'branches' for each of us.

1. Now open the repo you've just cloned in your code editor.

2. (Safety Ste9) Test and see if the repo is attached to git, type this into your terminals: `git remote -v`

3.
