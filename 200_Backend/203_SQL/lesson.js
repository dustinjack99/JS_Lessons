// Go over CRUD Operations
// Create, Read, Update, Delete.
// MOVE TO EXAMPLE YAAAY

// CREATE ("POST") - Creates an entry for the database.
// READ ("GET") - Reads any info from the database.
// UPDATE ("PUT") - Updates an entry in the database.
// DELETE ("DELETE") - Removes an entry from the database.

// SQL - structured querying language
//used for "querying data"
// write queries! Open pgAdmin, refer to practice.js

//SCHEMA - databases, think of them as a definition or the shape of the database. This is what our 'columns' should look like.

//QUERY - bit of SQL language, how you interact with the database. SEMICOLONS MATTER.
