It's a proud poppa moment. That's all there is! There isn't anymore! We have covered the last little important part of React: the component lifecycle and triggering re-renders with the all-powerful useEffect hook. So what now?

Your homework!

1. Remember that portfolio page you've been building? It's now time to make it into a full-fledged React app!

- For now, it is more than fine to still use create-react-app for your portfolio.

2. We've covered `react-router-dom`, use this to split apart your pages, then render each pages' UI with React JSX components.

3. You've had time to play around with NPM in homework and projects - why not jazz up your site with someone else's code!

4. Above all else... STYLE THAT MOFO! Shop around and look at other programmer / blogger sites, this will give you a good idea of what a professional site should look like.

5. Go through the process of deploying your app onto either GitHub or Heroku.

- What words would you google to accomplish this? Hint: `React` and `Deploy` are two of them.

**Additional Notes**

Really use this time to throw together a site. After Project 3 ends, it's time to throw together a resume and start the job hunt. We'll still meet up a few more weeks to help you along that horrendous process, but a website and a polished porfolio are must-haves.
