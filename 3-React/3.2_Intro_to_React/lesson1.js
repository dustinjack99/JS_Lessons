// we want to show you both versions of React, class-based and hooks-based apps

// today, we are going over the older version, which you will run into out in the wild.

// What is React?
// THE most in demand frontend library, it has become industry standard
// An open-source library from Facebook (META)!
// Developed to scale and build immense apps with rapidly changing data
// UI elements are broken into self-contained components
// Very, very testable, and also supported by Jest, the testing library made by Facebook

// Need an example of what React can do? Look at Facebook's website.

//Concept of Components
// Use facebook - look at how it may be broken apart in a component-based way.
// Broken down to the smallest, most reusable parts

//Data shifting applications
// We now make apps that have data that constantly changes / updates
// How do we make sure our app's front end keeps up with this data?

// State management!
//  - Instead of a billion event listeners, all you need to worry about the state of your app
//  - You can think of 'state' as the snapshot of your UI
//  - React allows your components to rerender the UI whenever their 'state' changes

// Why rerender components?
// DOM reloads are super expensive - updating the DOM recalculates CSS, layout, and repaints the page.
// Does this by making virtual DOM, which lives in one index.html file.

// PROS / CONS
// + Resuable components
// + UI updates state changes, reducing expensive DOM redraws
// + Can build React apps on web, server, desktop, and mobile
// + Easier learning curve than other frameworks, and most popular

// - Only a view library, not a complete framework.
// - Can require more config / setup than other libraries.

// UNDER THE HOOD
// Wepback - let's you modularize and transform you assets via plugins.
// Babel - transforms next-gen JS (ES6+) into ES5, which most browsers understand.

// JUMP TO LESSON2.JS
