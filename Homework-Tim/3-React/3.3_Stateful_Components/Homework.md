We've touched on making use of 'state' in our React components.

State is going to be an integral part in building out your React apps. This is the part of React that allows smart-refreshes of your individual components, instead of refreshing the entire page each and every time something in the UI changes.

State is also going to track the changes themselves, and will allow you to create constantly updating and dynamic elements in the front end of your applications.

For your homework:

1. I want you to use create-react-app and build me a stateful calculator app!

2. I want reusable components, rendering out all of the buttons on your calculator. This includes the number buttons and operator buttons ex. `+ - / *`.

3. You can use either Class Components or Function Components to accomplish this task. You'll have my deepest sympathies if you choose the class-based solution.

4. Your app should behave as follows: a user must type a number, then an operator, then another number, which will display on an input field. Once these three requiements are met, the user can hit `=` to run the calculation. If the user hasn't selected the right amount of numbers and operators, the `=` should be disabled.

5. I want style! GIVE ME ALL YOUR CSS! I want a sexy calculator.

**_Hints_**
Remember that you can track multiple stateful values in your components, and you can dictate certain behaviors in your UI based on the state of your app. Conditional values (booleans) are a powerful thing in a React app.

Remember that your components can be reused to accomplish the same task. Think about what parts of your UI can be made into a reusable React component. This will make the difference between this homework being 200 lines of code vs. 20. The cardinal rule of coding is DRY! (Don't Repeat Yourself).
