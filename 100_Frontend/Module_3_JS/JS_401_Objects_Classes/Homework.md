Armed with your knowledge of objects and classes, it's time to make a Superhero battle royale game!

Your superhero fighting game needs to be a knock-out brawler with six fighters on the page. These fighters must inherit functionality from three base classes: A superhero class, a supervillain class, and an original class you create yourself. All fighters must have a hit point value.

Each fighter must have two dropdown menus: one for their attacks, and one for whoever they target with the attack. When a fighter attacks another, I want their HP values to adjust in real time.

Each fighter needs to have three attacks they inhereit from their base class, along with two special attacks from their extended class.

When a fighter reaches 0 hit points, they die.

For a great working example, take a look at Ben's GitHub repo of his DBZ fighter he made:
