Armed with your knowledge of objects and classes, it's time to make a Superhero battle royale game!

Your superhero fighting game needs to be a knock-out brawler with six fighters on the page. These fighters must inherit functionality from three base classes: A superhero class, a supervillain class, and an original class you create yourself. All fighters must have a hit point value.

Each fighter must have two dropdown menus: one for their attacks, and one for whoever they target with the attack. When a fighter attacks another, I want their HP values to adjust in real time.

Each fighter needs to have three attacks they inhereit from their class, along with two attacks special to each hero.

When a fighter reaches 0 hit points, they die.

For a great working example, take a look at Ben's GitHub repo of his DBZ fighter he made:
