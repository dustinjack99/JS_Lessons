This week's homework is easy, but MANDATORY, in ALL CAPS.

1. Watch the Frontend Masters course on git:
   https://frontendmasters.com/courses/git-in-depth/

2. While watching, I want you to take notes on git commands we haven't covered in your new homework folders. Go to your personal JS202 folders, and write down the commands there. You will only need to write three commands we haven't covered, and what they do.

3. After you've added your comments, thereby changing the codebase of our shared git repo, guess what the next step is?

4. Correct! Use your newfound git knowledge and push the changes to our repo.

5. Marvel at your git superpowers.

The video is a three and a half hour course. This lecture will pay off tremendously when you start collaborating on your first project. The basics will be re-taught in the video, as well as introduce you to some more advanced concepts.

Going forward, we will be giving you git practice by using this repo for all of your future homeworks, and using this repo to push up changes for all to admire!

Moreso, once you start collaborating with each other, you'll be VERY THANKFUL once we covered git. It will prevent you from constantly overwriting each other's code. It also has to power for us to roll back to previous commits (think of it as a save point).

GIT. IS. A. LIFESAVER.
Commit early, Commit often.

Cheers, and have fun watching the video. :)
