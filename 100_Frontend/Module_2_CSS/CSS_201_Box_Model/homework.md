**- Assignment -**

The Box Model is the most foundational CSS concept to learn when it comes to layout and positioning.

Building on our understanding of margin, padding, borders, and a content's height and width, we can now start positioning our 3-page website. So it's time to build the rest of it!

This week's homework includes:

1. Building out the rest of your website.

- Fill out the `aboutme.html` page with content about yourself! It can include your hobbies, goals, and ramblings you have in your head.
- In your `contact.html` page, include ways for people (employers) to get ahold of you! There should be links to your social media profiles, an email address.
- Your home page (`index.html`) should include an image (or three!) of yourself doing something fun. Your name should display loud and proud, along with some splash text introducing yourself to the world.
- Remember links that navigate between all three pages!

2. Applying all of our CSS knowledge!

- In all three of your web pages, I want you to lean heavily into colors, fonts, and layout (margin, padding, borders)
- A good exercise is to throw borders around everything to see how adjusting `border`, `padding` and `margin` affects elements in your HTML.
- Specifics!
  - `index.html`: I want the image(s) of yourself centered! Perfectly centered! Hint: `margin` can take more than a `px` value!
  - `about.html`: If you have lists of your hobbies and goals, I want the padding between the list element to be even across all elements.
  - `contact.html`: I want your social media links to be side-by-side horizontally. Don't worry if this is very tricky to accomplish with just `margin`, `padding`, etc! I want you to find another solution... Google is your friend!
