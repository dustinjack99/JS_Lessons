- What is it? Cascading Style Sheets
- (Pillar 2 of 3 of the frontend)
- CSS is a language that describes the style of an HTML document.
- CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed.
- This tutorial will teach you CSS starting from the basics.

**_ LETS CODE! _**

- Create a new file called `style.css` and we still link it to our HTML file with the `<link>` tag.
- Add the following code to your `style.css` file:

```css
body {
  background-color: red;
}
```

- Now, refresh your browser and you should see the background color of your page change to red.
- Let's add some more CSS to our `style.css` file:

```css
body {
  background-color: red;
  color: white;
}
```

- Now, refresh your browser and you should see the background color of your page change to red and the text color change to white.
- We can see that we're able to change the color of the text and the background of the page, but what if we want to change the color of the text in the header?
