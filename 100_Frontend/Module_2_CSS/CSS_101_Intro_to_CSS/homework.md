**- Assignment -**

1. Using your newfound CSS knowledge, style your HTML page from the previous lesson. Make it look however you want, but make sure you use at least 3 different CSS properties.

2. The three different styles I want you to use are:

   - background-color
   - color
   - font-size

3. Branching out and exploring your ability to learn new things is a big part of being a developer. So, for this assignment, I want you to use the following resources to learn about a new CSS property and use it in your assignment.
   - MDN: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference
   - Recommended properties to look into:
     - font-family
     - font-weight
     - text-align
     - border
     - border-radius
