**- Assignment -**

Flexbox and grids are the best way to position your elements across all display sizes, and making your site responsive.

Your homework includes two parts.

1. Play Flexbox Froggy!

- This is a wonderful web game that teaches you all the functionality of flexbox and positioning flexed elements - in the form of a fun game=!
- https://flexboxfroggy.com/
- Yes, you have to beat the game!

2. Using your knowledge (and having conquered flexbox froggy), use flexbox and grids to iterate on your three page website.

- The flexboxes and grids should make all of your layout responsive
- Your UI elements should now fit in both rows and columns. I want at least one set of elements per page that displays as a row (instead of a column).
