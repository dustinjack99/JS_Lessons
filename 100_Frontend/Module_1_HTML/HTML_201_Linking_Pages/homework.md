**- Assignment -**

You've taken your first steps into WebDev! Hooray!

To recap your learning of HTML, here's some exercises that you can do:

1. Create a three-page website that uses these HTML tags to structure your webpage. Your webpage should have three pages:

   - An About Me Page
   - A Home Page
   - A Hobbies Page

2. Use these tags that we covered somewhere on your three pages:

   - `<a>` tags to navigate between your web pages. Along with linking to another website entirely.
   - `<h1>` tags to lay our important headers.
   - `<p>` tags to display text information.
   - `<img>` tags to find images around the internet.

3. Do some fun research, on MDN, and find 3 HTML tags we have not covered!
   - Don't worry if these break and don't work, I just want you to research and play around.
